[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/reinpk/radioactive.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/reinpk/radioactive)


A library to model nuclear physics in javascript. Intended for building visualizations and interactive demonstrations.

## Usage

### Decay
The decay module exposes four main functions.

#### products(isotope)
Get the decay products for the given `isotope`. The `isotope` parameter is a compact name like `Pu-239`.

```javascript
radioactive.decay.products('Pu-239');
```

returns an array of products produced in the decay process:

```javascript
[
    {
        fraction : 1,       // in the range [0, 1]
        product  : 'U-235'  // a compact isotope name
    },
    ...
]
```

#### chain(isotope)
Get the complete decay chain for the given `isotope`. The `isotope` parameter is a compact name like `Y-99`.

```javascript
radioactive.decay.chain('Y-99');
```

returns an array of products produced in the decay process:

```javascript
["Y-99", "Zr-99", "Nb-99m", "Nb-99", "Mo-99m2", "Mo-99m1", "Mo-99", "Tc-99m", "Tc-99"]
```

#### mass(charge)
Get a decay profile of isotope mass for a starting `charge` of isotopes. The `charge` parameter is a dictionary of compact isotope names (like `Pu-239') to initial charges (kilograms) of that isotope.

```javascript
radioactive.decay.mass({
    'Y-99' : 1 //kilograms
});
```

returns a function that can be passed `time` in years. That function will return a dictionary of isotope masses remaining at that time:

```javascript
{
    'Y-99'  : 0.02, // kilograms
    'Zr-99' : 0.8, // kilograms
    ...other isotopes...
    'total   : 1   // kilograms
}
```

#### radioactivity(charge)
Get a decay profile of radioactivity for a starting `charge` of isotopes. The `charge` parameter is a dictionary of compact isotope names (like `Pu-239') to initial charges (kilograms) of that isotope.

```javascript
radioactive.decay.radioactivity({
    'Y-99' : 1 //kilograms
});
```

returns a function that can be passed `time` in years. That function will return a dictionary of isotope masses remaining at that time:

```javascript
{
    'Y-99' : 5510123, // becquerels
    ...other isotopes...
    'total : 14310123 // becquerels
}
```

### Fission & Neutron Capture
This module isn't implemented yet. Simulating fission and neutron capture is a real-time process, and needs totally different math & datasets.

Things this module will need to know about

+ Fission isotope spread
+ Neutron absorption probabilities for different energies and istopes
+ Energies and products released
+ Geometry of the situation
+ Accompanying thermal model would make it actually useful

Contributions are welcome!
