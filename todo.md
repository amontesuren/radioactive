# Todo

- clean up the decayProfile function
    - one function to get whole decay chain (no branches for now)
    - simplify loop to use coefficient equations more clearly
    - figure out how to get units/amounts working with profiles
    - add cutoff at param || background levels to profile functions 
- set up decay demo
    - add nuclear.js and d3.js to the page
    - add custom js to the page
    - set up d3 svg area in html
    - write a once-through script that just renders a nice log/log plot
    - switch static data to use decay profile
    - get decay profile for a real nuclear plant (or 2 or 3)
    - compare our math to a reliable source
    - add a selectable legend to the d3 plot
    - add descriptions of each type of reactor & initial waste profile
