        <p>Which reactor designs produce less waste? What does "less" mean?</p>

        <h3>Radioactive Decay</h3>
        <p>
          Modeling radioactive decay is important for understanding nuclear waste and its long-term impact.
        </p>
        <p>
          There seems to be very little widespread, accurate knowledge of what "nuclear waste" means, how we deal with it, or how waste differs across reactor types. Check out the demo comparing waste profiles for different types of nuclear reactors.

        <h3>Fission and Neutron Absorption</h3>
        <p>
          Modeling fission is important if you want to simulate reactor cores. These are not yet implemented. There are two main reasons: there doesn't yet seem to be a solid enough linear algebra library for in-browser numerical modeling, and the underlying physics is really complicated and sensitive to things like geometry... complicated! But I'd love to move this direction.</p>
